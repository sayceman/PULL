This is my first great book

Let's see how it looks.

It looks pretty good, let's get started

In this book, tentatively called 'War Stories,' I've concocted a series of short stories that run the gamut of the modern American experience, but each of which has a reference to the wars that largely defined the 2000s for a very small subset of the population.  Like a XXX, the effects of these wars were felt enormously by a small community, and only very slightly by many others, at least directly.  But throught the subtle transmutations of all societies, and accentuated by cable television and the internet, the effects of those wars have reverberated far beyond the people who directly participated in them.
