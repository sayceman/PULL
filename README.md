This is my first great book

Let's see how it looks.

It looks pretty good, let's get started

I'll lay out an introduction to the book here.

Then I'll give an overview of each story - maybe a sneak peek into how I came up with the idea, or a character that was particularly intriguing, or something that might be enticing to a reader.

Then, hopefully, I'd have a nice foreword from someone who's well known in the field....

Actually, scrap that - let's change the intro part entirely.  Maybe it's just a TOC, then all the stories, then the "intro" and "foreword" at the end.

Maybe even I do a brief blurb on why you should read each story up front (or someone else does) and save the essay for last.

I always hate that feeling when you finish a book and there's nothing more written....is there some way to help people exit from that moment of catharsis appropriately?
